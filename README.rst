This Asphalt framework component provides integration with the commercial Sentry_ service.

It provides a facility for applications to report exceptions to Sentry_ and a plugin system
that allows additional metadata from a particular context class to be added to the report.
Additionally, it will set itself as the default asyncio exception handler.
